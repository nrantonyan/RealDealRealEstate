# RealDealRealEstate

Real Deal Real Estate is a web application designed for the purpose of providing real estate developers and agents with a one-stop goto for finding potential projects as well as building a preliminary proforma.

Like most mainstream real estate sites Real Deal provides the user with access to a millions of homes currently on the market nationwide. However, we take it one step further by providing a platform for collaboration with the real estate team and an in-depth calculator which tracks projected costs and hiding fees.
